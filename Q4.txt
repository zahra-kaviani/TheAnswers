Q4
Explain the Visibility Quantifiers in Solidity language in detail (4 points).
In Solidity, you can control who has access to the functions and state variables in your contract and how they interact with them. This concept is known as visibility.
Following are various visibility quantifiers for functions/state variables of a contract.
* external ? External functions are meant to be called by other contracts. They cannot be used for internal call. To call external function within contract this.function_name() call is required. State variables cannot be marked as external.
* public ? Public functions/ Variables can be used both externally and internally. For public state variable, Solidity automatically creates a getter function.
* internal ? Internal functions/ Variables can only be used internally or by derived contracts.
* private ? Private functions/ Variables can only be used internally and not even by derived contracts.
