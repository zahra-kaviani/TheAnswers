Q9:
Could we inherit from more than one contract? (If it’s possible How?) (3 points)
Solidity supports inheritance between smart contracts, where multiple contracts can be inherited into a single contract. The contract from which other contracts inherit features is known as a base contract, while the contract which inherits the features is called a derived contract
Some of the key highlights of Solidity are: 
* A derived contract can access all non-private members including state variables and internal methods. But using this is not allowed.
* Function overriding is allowed provided function signature remains the same. In case of the difference of output parameters, the compilation will fail.
* We can call a super contract’s function using a super keyword or using a super contract name.
* In the case of multiple inheritances, function calls using super gives preference to most derived contracts.
